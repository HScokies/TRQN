    "description" : "Ooooweee that’s sour! Pucker up, then kiss the ground. The Gobstomper Sour Edition extends MSCHF’s line of shoes that get better the more you fall down. EVERY part of the Gobstomper is made of 4 layers of colored material, from the tongue to the upper to the sole, which reveal themselves as the shoe wears down. If you don’t wear down your shoes fast enough, learn to skate or buy a Dremel.",
